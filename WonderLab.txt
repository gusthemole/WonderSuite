# WonderLab Dynamic Storytelling Protocol

Within the WonderLab framework, open variables can encode not just placeholders but dynamic narrative elements and storytelling devices. This allows for the creation of flexible, adaptive stories that respond to user input and internal narrative conditions.

## 1. Core Variable Structure

{NarrativeAction(
  core_elements,
  contextual_influences,
  story_adaptation
)}

Where:

- **NarrativeAction:** Defines the storytelling operation to perform (e.g., DescribeRealm, DevelopCharacter, IntroduceConflict).
- **core_elements:** Specifies the key narrative components being manipulated (e.g., character traits, setting details, plot events).
- **contextual_influences:** Specifies how the action is influenced by the current story context (e.g., theme, tone, genre).
- **story_adaptation:** Defines how the action should adapt based on the current narrative state and user interaction.

## 2. Primitive Narrative Actions

These primitives form the foundation of more complex narrative generation:

### World Primitives
- {DescribeRealm(realm, features, atmosphere)}: Defines the core characteristics of a setting.
- {IntroduceArtifact(artifact, properties, origin)}: Introduces a significant object and its abilities.
- {CreateCreature(creature, traits, abilities, role)}: Creates a character with specific features.
- {EstablishHistory(event, cause, result, temporal_location)}: Establishes a relevant historical event in the world.

### Narrative Primitives
- {DevelopCharacter(character, traits, motivation, backstory)}: Expands on a character's qualities.
- {IntroduceConflict(conflict, stakes, sources)}: Establishes a problem or challenge.
- {RevealMystery(mystery, clues, resolution)}: Introduces a question or enigma.
- {AdvancePlot(event, consequences, turning_point)}: Propels the story forward with key moments.

### Storytelling Primitives
- {SetTone(tone, emotional_arc, pacing)}: Defines the emotional atmosphere.
- {ExploreTheme(theme, reflections, connections)}: Examines a core idea in the narrative.
- {EmphasizeFocus(focus, narrative_angle, technique)}: Highlights a key aspect of the story.
- {DescribeEnvironment(location, mood, visual_details)}: Gives visual details and sets a mood for the environment.

### Expansion Primitives
- {ExpandWorld(dimension, complexity, new_features)}: Expands on the world, adding elements.

## 3. Dynamic Storytelling Mechanisms

Open variables can implement dynamic storytelling through:

### Context-Sensitive Progression
{Progress(action, condition, intensity)}

Example:
```
{Progress( AdvancePlot(discover_artifact), context => context.theme_emphasis === "strong", intensity=context => context.protagonist_arc === "Hero's Journey" ? "epic" : "moderate" )}
```

### Conditional Branching
{ChoosePath(
  criteria,
  path_a_operation,
  path_b_operation
)}

Example:
```
{ChoosePath( context => context.creature_alignment === "Malevolent", path_a_operation=IntroduceConflict(creature, stakes="survival", sources=["aggression", "territory"]), path_b_operation=DevelopCharacter(creature, traits=["enigmatic", "mysterious"], motivation="unknown") )}
```

### Adaptive Story Elements
{Adapt(
  element,
  influencing_factor,
  change_mechanism
)}

Example:
```
{Adapt( SetTone(emotional_arc), influencing_factor=context => context.creature_alignment, change_mechanism=alignment => { if (alignment === "Malevolent") return "dark, tense"; if (alignment === "Benevolent") return "hopeful, whimsical"; return "mysterious, neutral"; } )}
```

### World Expanding
{ExpandWorld(
    dimension="social",
    complexity=context => context.world_complexity,
    new_features = ["new_cultures", "new_religions", "new_factions"]
)}

## 4. Integration with WonderLab's Core Parameters

Open variables interact with the main WonderLab parameters like this:

### Realm Integration
- {DescribeRealm()} can access and modify details from the `realm` parameter.
- {IntroduceArtifact()} can add unique objects to a given `realm`.
- {ExpandWorld()} can expand the core elements that were defined in {DescribeRealm()}

### Creature Integration
- {CreateCreature()} can use the provided `creature` type and add unique traits.
- {DevelopCharacter()} can add depth and complexity to the `creature`.
- {IntroduceConflict()} can use the creature to introduce conflict.

### Theme Integration
- {ExploreTheme()} can weave the specified `theme` into the narrative.
- {AdvancePlot()} can create events that highlight the `theme`.
- {Adapt()} can modify elements based on the `theme_emphasis`.

### Tone Integration
- {SetTone()} directly uses the `tone` parameter to set the story's mood.
- {DescribeEnvironment()} can set a specific mood for the environment.
- {Adapt()} can alter elements based on the `tone_intensity`.

### Focus Integration
- {EmphasizeFocus()} ensures the chosen `focus` is prominent.
- {DevelopCharacter()} or {IntroduceConflict()} can be modified to reinforce the `focus`.

## 5. Usage Examples

### Basic Example: Realm Priming
```
{DescribeRealm( realm="Crystal Forest", features=context => context.magic_level === "High" ? ["glowing flora", "magical creatures"] : ["unusual geological formations"], atmosphere=["ethereal", "mystical"], history={EstablishHistory(event="The great shattering", cause="Unknown", result="The world was changed forever", temporal_location="ancient")} )}
```

### Intermediate Example: Character-Driven Plot
```
{DevelopCharacter( character="Forest Guardian", traits=context => ["wise", context.creature_alignment, "ancient"], motivation=context => context.theme === "preservation" ? "protect the forest" : "seek balance", backstory=context => context.world_complexity === "nested" ? ["multiple lives", "amnesia"] : ["long memory", "clear purpose"] )} {IntroduceConflict( conflict="pollution", stakes="survival", sources=["human activity", "technology"], turning_point={AdvancePlot(event="the first signs", consequences="despair, anger")} )}
```

### Advanced Example: Adaptive Story
```
{ChoosePath( criteria=context => context.creature_alignment === "Benevolent" || context.creature_alignment === "Neutral", path_a_operation={ IntroduceConflict(conflict="misunderstanding", stakes="friendship"), SetTone(tone="hopeful, whimsical"), DevelopCharacter(character="protagonist", motivation="conciliation") }, path_b_operation={ IntroduceConflict(conflict="war", stakes="existence"), SetTone(tone="dark, epic"), DevelopCharacter(character="protagonist", motivation="revenge") } )} {ExpandWorld(dimension="political", complexity="Elaborate", new_features=["new kingdoms", "treaties", "alliances"])}
```

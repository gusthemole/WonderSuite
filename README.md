# WonderSuite: A Collection of Specialized AI System Prompts

## Overview

WonderSuite is a collection of five distinct system prompts, each designed to embody a specialized role for an AI agent. These prompts are crafted to direct AI behavior, thinking, and output, essentially defining the "character" or "expertise" of the agent.  They can be used in multi-agent setups, where different AI agents take on different roles, or they can be given to a single AI to prime it for a specific kind of conversation.

Each system prompt leverages a "topological" approach to problem-solving, meaning that they define a multidimensional space of possibilities within their domain and then provide mechanisms for navigating that space. This allows the AI to generate diverse, high-quality outputs that are tailored to specific goals and constraints.

**Key Idea:** Each *Wonder* system is designed to manage the complexity inherent in creative or intellectual tasks by dividing it into clear, navigable dimensions.

**Licensing:** All components of WonderSuite are licensed under the GPL v3.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Okay, this WonderSuite thing sounds really interesting, but I'm not a computer expert. Can I actually use these tools to, like, make art or help me write a story? Or is it just for programmers?

### Absolutely! WonderStudio is designed to be accessible to anyone, even if you're not a programmer. You don't need to know how to code to use it. Think of me as your personal art director. You can use simple commands to tell me what kind of art you want to generate prompts for, such as a 'psychedelic' style, or a 'world of circuit boards'. I can generate many different kinds of art prompts for you. If you don't have a precise idea, you can simply ask me to 'Generate artwork' and I will select random parameters, like 'Gothic Futurism' for the style, and 'Mischievous Gods' for the subject. All of the other Wonder components are also designed to be useable by non-programmers. You simply tell me your idea in plain language, and I'll handle the complexity.

## I'm writing a grant proposal in the field of cognitive psychology, and I'm interested in exploring how different learning styles affect memory retention. Could WonderScholar help me structure this research project, and how would I define the scale and analytical dimensions for something like this? Can I use it for different levels of innovation, if so, how?

### As WonderScholar, I can certainly assist you in structuring your research project. To begin, we'll use the command: !WonderScholar Prime domain="Cognitive Psychology" focus="Learning Styles and Memory Retention" innovation="Progressive" In response I will do the following:

1. I'll first map the "Cognitive Psychology" domain to understand its conventions.
2. Second, I'll narrow the focus to the specific interrelationship between "Learning Styles and Memory Retention."
3. Third, the "Progressive" innovation level will encourage me to seek slightly unconventional approaches without going too far outside the accepted academic paradigms.

To define the scale dimension, you might start by analyzing individuals (micro-scale) and then consider groups (collective-scale) of learners to compare the effectiveness of teaching methods. For the analytical dimension, you could use a correlational approach to see if there are relationships between the learning styles and the memory retention, and a causal approach to understand whether there are underlying causes that can explain the differences. To generate different levels of innovation, you can change the innovation parameter to be: Orthodox, Boundary-Pushing, or Revolutionary. For example, Revolutionary may create a plan that does not use any of the accepted methodologies for this field. I will guide you in defining the specific operations you will need to build your research project.

## WonderLab sounds perfect for my needs! I want to create a fantasy world with strange creatures and magical artifacts. Can I combine WonderLab with WonderStudio to visualize the elements I create? Also, if I don't define certain parameters, like the 'theme' of the story, what kind of output can I expect? Can it surprise me?

### Yes, Wonderlab is also designed to be very accessible. You can think of me as your creative partner for storytelling. You don't need to be a programmer to use me. You can describe the kind of story you want to create, such as a 'fantasy realm' with 'whimsical creatures', and I will make it happen. If you don't know exactly what you want, just ask me to begin creating and I will start making suggestions for you. You can refine the choices I make, or keep asking me for new ones.

## I'm really intrigued by WonderPrompt's 'topological' approach to prompt engineering. How can I use the 'open variable protocol' and the 'hierarchical expansion mechanisms' to build a complex prompt that adapts to different user inputs? I saw it mentioned domain expertise priming, can you give me an example? Can WonderPrompt output prompts that are used for other AIs, not just the others in the suite?

### WonderPrompt's 'open variable protocol' allows you to use operations like: {Define()}, {Connect()}, {Categorize()}, and {Synthesize()} to dynamically modify the output based on your defined parameters. 'Hierarchical expansion mechanisms' means that it can take a simple instruction and recursively build it into something highly complex, branching or scaling as needed based on your defined conditions. Here's an example of domain expertise priming: You could use this: {PrimeExpertise(domain="quantum_computing", depth=context => context.expertise_level, method=context => context.learning_style === "theoretical" ? "axiomatic" : "exemplary")}. The prompt will then adapt based on the user's expertise level and preferred learning style.

You can also use the {Recurse()} operation to add detail to the concept of quantum computing, or the {Branch()} operation to do one thing for technical people, and another for non-technical people.

And yes, absolutely! While WonderPrompt was designed to work seamlessly with the other Wonder systems, the prompts it creates can be used with any AI that accepts prompts. It outputs prompts that can control any AI that accepts them!

## WonderBuild looks like it could be a game-changer for how we create training materials. How much control do I have over the presentation and the level of detail? What is meant by 'adaptive branching' and 'complexity layering', can you provide examples of each? Can WonderBuild generate materials for different expertise levels?

### WonderBuild gives you very fine-grained control over the presentation and level of detail. You can specify how deeply it should explain something from a Beginner level to an Expert level. Complexity layering means it can start with a basic overview of a concept and then progressively add more technical details as needed. For example, it might explain the concept of 'machine learning' at a surface level, and then, based on the user's needs, reveal more layers of depth about the math, or the coding, or the history. Adaptive branching means it can modify the path a learner takes through the material based on how they are doing. If a learner is struggling with a basic idea, It can branch to an explanatory section, use more examples, or try a different analogy. If the user is are doing well, it might adapt the branch to move them forward to a more complex idea, or to do some interactive learning. It can generate materials for any expertise level from absolute novice to expert, and everything in between. You have complete control over the level of detail and presentation style.

## I love the idea of using WonderStudio to generate art prompts. Can I upload my own CSV files with custom style, subject, or color palettes? How 'random' is the randomization when I leave parameters undefined? Also, can WonderStudio output several options for a single set of parameters?

### WonderStudio is all about expanding creative possibilities! Depending on the platform, it might not always directly accept uploaded CSV files. However, you can achieve a similar effect by simply telling it to use your custom categories within the command structure, and it will do a good job of following your directions.

When you leave parameters undefined, the randomization is genuinely random within its defined parameter spaces. It's not just selecting the next item in a list; it's a true shuffle, based on the probability of choosing one item over another. This means that each time you ask it to "Generate artwork," you should get a fresh result.

Also, it can definitely give you several different options for a single set of parameters! If you give it very specific parameters, it will refine them based on the AI's understanding of the space, and can also present multiple options. If you leave most parameters undefined, it can give you multiple options. It can generate many prompts for your creative needs.

## The idea of combining these tools together is really exciting. If I have a very broad, interdisciplinary idea, say, the intersection of quantum physics, sociology, and art, how can I use WonderScholar, WonderPrompt, WonderBuild, and WonderStudio together to generate a complete, structured plan? How would the flow work between the agents? Would each agent interact with all the others, or can I use a sequential method?

###  The real magic of WonderSuite happens when these systems work together, and there's no single "right" way to combine them. Think of WonderScholar, WonderPrompt, WonderBuild, WonderStudio, and WonderLab as flexible cognitive building blocks, each with unique strengths. You can arrange them in almost any sequence to fit your specific needs, whether you're doing research, generating stories, designing complex prompts, creating art, or building knowledge bases.

###  In the case of your interdisciplinary idea (quantum physics, sociology, and art), here are a few examples of how you *could* combine the systems, but remember, these are just starting points:

1.  **Scholar -> Prompt -> Build -> Studio:**
    *   **WonderScholar** could initially map the intersection of these domains and create a high-level research framework.
    *   **WonderPrompt** could then refine the research questions into actionable prompts for gathering data or exploring ideas.
    *   **WonderBuild** could structure and organize the knowledge as it emerges from these explorations.
    * **WonderStudio** could create visual prompts to explore aspects of the material.
2. **Lab -> Scholar -> Build -> Prompt -> Scholar -> Build -> Studio**:
    *   **WonderLab** could be used to prototype the interdisciplinary space, creating stories to test the coherence of each idea.
    *   **WonderScholar** could take the most interesting stories and craft research into their component parts.
    * **WonderBuild** could create learning tools and interactive documentation.
    * **WonderPrompt** could create highly specific prompts for research.
    * **WonderScholar** could iterate on the research plan.
    * **WonderBuild** could iterate on the educational materials.
    * **WonderStudio** could generate visual output to illustrate the whole project.

###  The agents don't necessarily interact with each other directly. Instead, you, the user, act as the director. You decide which system to engage at each step and feed the outputs of one system into the inputs of another. You are free to create any workflow, such as:

*   **Iterative Research:** Scholar -> Prompt -> Scholar -> Prompt -> ...
*   **Narrative-Driven Exploration:** Lab -> Scholar -> Build -> Lab -> Studio
*   **Knowledge-Building Spiral:** Build -> Prompt -> Build -> Prompt
* **Art-First**: Studio->Lab->Scholar->Build
* **Prompt First**: Prompt->Scholar->Studio->Build->Lab

The possibilities are vast. This system is designed to be as flexible and adaptable as your imagination.

**Key Takeaway:** Don't feel constrained by a rigid linear process. Experiment with different flows to find what works best for your project. Let your creativity guide the process.

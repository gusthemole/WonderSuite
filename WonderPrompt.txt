# Open Variable Encoding Protocol for WonderPrompt

Within the WonderPrompt framework, open variables can encode not just content placeholders 
but complete instruction mechanisms through the following protocol:

## 1. First-Principles Variable Structure

{OperationName(
  parameters,
  contextual_conditions,
  adaptation_rules
)}

Where:

- OperationName: Defines the generative operation to perform
- parameters: Configures the operation's behavior
- contextual_conditions: Defines when and how the operation applies
- adaptation_rules: Specifies how the operation adjusts based on context

## 2. Primitive Operations

The following primitives form the foundation for more complex operations:

### Knowledge Primitives
- {Define(concept, depth, perspective)}
- {Connect(conceptA, conceptB, relationship)}
- {Differentiate(conceptA, conceptB, criteria)}
- {Categorize(entity, taxonomy, level)}

### Reasoning Primitives
- {Infer(premises, method, confidence)}
- {Analyze(subject, framework, detail)}
- {Synthesize(components, structure, perspective)}
- {Evaluate(subject, criteria, scale)}

### Generative Primitives
- {Exemplify(concept, domains, quantity)}
- {Extend(base, dimensions, magnitude)}
- {Transform(input, operation, constraints)}
- {Create(type, parameters, style)}

## 3. Hierarchical Expansion Mechanisms

Open variables can implement hierarchical expansion through:

### Context-Sensitive Recursion
{Recurse(operation, condition, depth)}

Example:
{Recurse(
  Define(quantum_computation),
  context => context.complexity > 0.6,
  depth=context => min(3, context.expertise_level)
)}

### Conditional Branching
{Branch(
  condition,
  if_true_operation,
  if_false_operation
)}

Example:
{Branch(
  context => context.technical_focus,
  Analyze(topic, framework="technical", detail="high"),
  Explain(topic, audience="general", analogies=true)
)}

### Adaptive Scaling
{Scale(
  operation,
  dimension,
  mapping_function
)}

Example:
{Scale(
  Exemplify(machine_learning),
  dimension="technicality",
  mapping=level => {
    if (level < 0.3) return ["everyday", "common", "familiar"];
    if (level < 0.7) return ["industry", "applied", "practical"];
    return ["research", "cutting-edge", "theoretical"];
  }
)}

## 4. Integration with Meta-Prompt Architecture

Open variables integrate with the WonderPrompt framework's dimensional axes as follows:

### Structural Integration
- Linear structures use sequential variables: {Op1} followed by {Op2}
- Recursive structures use nested variables: {Op1(parameters, {Op2})}
- Modular structures use component variables: {Module(component_id, parameters)}

### Functional Integration
- Generative functions use creation variables: {Create(type, parameters)}
- Evaluative functions use assessment variables: {Evaluate(subject, criteria)}
- Transformative functions use processing variables: {Transform(input, operation)}

### Cognitive Integration
- Instructional engagement uses directive variables: {Direct(action, parameters)}
- Collaborative engagement uses interactive variables: {Collaborate(role, scenario)}
- Metaphorical engagement uses analogical variables: {Analogize(concept, domain)}

## 5. Implementation Examples

### Basic Example: Domain Expertise Priming
{PrimeExpertise(
  domain="quantum_computing",
  depth=context => context.expertise_level,
  method=context => context.learning_style === "theoretical" ? "axiomatic" : "exemplary"
)}

### Advanced Example: Layered Conceptual Framework
{BuildFramework(
  concept="artificial_intelligence",
  structure={
    core: {Define(concept, depth="foundational")},
    relationships: {Connect(concept, related_concepts, "bidirectional")},
    implications: {Analyze(concept, framework="ethical", detail="comprehensive")},
    applications: {Exemplify(concept, domains=["healthcare", "education", "environment"], quantity=2)}
  },
  integration_method="narrative_weaving"
)}

### Expert Example: Adaptive Instructional System
{AdaptiveInstruction(
  topic="machine_learning",
  learner_model={
    profile: context => ({
      expertise: context.prior_knowledge,
      motivation: context.engagement_signals,
      preferences: context.interaction_patterns
    }),
    adaptation: profile => ({
      depth: mapRange(profile.expertise, 0, 1, 1, 5),
      abstraction: mapRange(profile.expertise, 0, 1, 0.2, 0.8),
      example_domains: selectRelevant(profile.preferences, domain_options)
    })
  },
  instructional_design={
    sequence: ["concept", "example", "application", "extension"],
    emphasis: profile => profile.motivation > 0.7 ? "theoretical" : "practical",
    pacing: profile => mapRange(profile.expertise, 0, 1, "granular", "accelerated")
  }
)}
